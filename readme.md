# Communication in Psychotherapy: A Process-Oriented Approach to Rupture, Repair, and Change

A comprehensive course on professional communication for psychologists and psychotherapists, with a process-oriented focus on rupture, repair, and change.

## Overview

This course focuses on communication as the fundamental tool of psychological practice. Unlike traditional approaches that reduce communication to "listening skills" or "empathy," this course treats communication as a complex professional system that requires systematic training.

## Course Structure

The course consists of 23 chapters organized into four main blocks:

1. **Block I: Theoretical Foundations and Professional Position** (Chapters 1-10)
   - Communication models
   - Perception and interpretation
   - Establishing contact
   - Professional identity
   - Functions of professional statements
   - Power in communication
   - Listening, questions, metacommunication

2. **Block II: Traps, Defenses, and Errors** (Chapters 11-14)
   - Psychological defenses in communication
   - Communicative traps
   - Therapist errors
   - Dialogue dynamics

3. **Block III: Client States and Clinical Practice** (Chapters 15-19)
   - Mental states in communication
   - Communication in mental disorders
   - Nonverbal communication
   - Ethical communication
   - Individual communication styles

4. **Block IV: Practice and Mastery** (Chapters 20-23)
   - Transcript analysis
   - Exercises with failures
   - Mastery criteria
   - Checklists and protocols

Plus extensive appendices with practical tools, transcripts, checklists, and exercises.

## Target Audience

- Psychology students (bachelor's and master's level)
- Beginning practitioners
- Experienced therapists seeking to deepen their communicative competence
- Supervisors and instructors developing practical programs

The course is valuable for practitioners of various approaches: psychodynamic, cognitive, humanistic, systemic, body-oriented, and integrative.

## What Makes This Course Different

1. **Communication as a professional system**, not just techniques
2. **Full section on metacommunication** - a key skill often overlooked
3. **Focus on therapist errors** - not just client difficulties
4. **Emphasis on contact dynamics** - one of the strongest predictors of therapeutic effectiveness
5. **Systematic description of nonverbal communication** as a professional tool
6. **Ethical dimension** of therapist's speech influence
7. **Supporting client autonomy** as an independent professional module
8. **Complete set of methodological materials**: transcripts, checklists, role-playing exercises, algorithms, tables
